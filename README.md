# trilliumshowfx
`trilliumshowfx` is a program that takes a CSV file containing image file and owner names
downloaded from my photography club website, and builds title images and an Excel spreadsheet
(XLS) file for input into flexishow to display the slideshow. These slideshows are used to
display images for competitions, non-competition events which we call Theme Nights, and in
special interest groups.

More information about the program, how to run it, and how to build it is provided in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/jimorc/trilliumshowfx/wiki).
